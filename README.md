# Milestone Project 1

My project is for a mma gym. This sight is made for people that want to join a mma gym and start beginning there journey in the martial arts.
Training mma is also a really good way to relieve stress and make life long friends.

# UX

This website is made for the averrage person who is looking to get into mma most gyms websites are over saturated with information and words that new people may not understand.
The navigation is also very simple so anyone can use the site.

# Features

Navbar: Each section of the navbar takes you to it's own individual page and also opens in a new tab.
Sign-up: The sign-up button takes you to a page on a new tab with a sign-up form to fill in.

# Testing

Everything went relatively smoothly when doing this I only seemed to have a problem when I was doing the sign-up form, but that was quickly solved.

# Deployment 

I ran into no problems deploying this page

# Credits
